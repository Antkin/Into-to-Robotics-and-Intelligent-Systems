#Mapping and CartPole Robot Control
Part 1 of this project was to implement an occupancy grid mapping system. The build_occ_map.py file reads pre-recorded odometry and lidar scans from a file and processes them. 
Part 2 of this project was to implement and tune a PID and LQR controller for balancing a pole on a cart that can move from side to side.
